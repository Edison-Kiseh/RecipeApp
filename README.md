# RecipeApp

This is by my favourite project ever made! It is a recipe application for android, which i used android studio (kotlin based) to build and i really really love it. The teacher did too.

This application is a recipe app design for you! You can add recipes as in their images, name, description, steps followed and ingredients and these will all be saved up and displayed in the homepage where you can quickly select them in the nice ui and view all these details.
